          <h1>Why am I Applying</h1>
          <p>
            The journey of learning to code has been difficult as I had to find
            my discipline and patience towards developing better problem solving
            skills. Whether it was researching optimal solutions, simply trying
            to comprehend a new concept or having the mental discipline to push
            forward. That’s the beauty of coding, no matter how much you know
            there is always more to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            I fell in love with coding because it stimulates and challenges my
            mind in ways that I never thought was possible. I began seeing
            things differently, slowly learning to break them down into their
            individual components. So an action of getting into a car can be
            split from 1 'step into multiple steps that can have various
            if-checks and other logical variables to consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            If my application is successful, joining Founders & Coders can help
            me strengthen the coding foundations I have already built and fill
            in any knowledge gaps standing in between where I am now and me
            becoming a professional junior developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another aspect where attending the boot camp will pay great dividend
            is in helping me to prepare for job interviews. This is an area that
            I’d struggle with if I were doing it alone but I hope that by
            working closely with and learning from other like-minded people, I
            can gain the confidence and skills to pursue my dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which brings me to the greatest opportunity of this bootcamp, being
            surrounded by like-minded people who want to better themselves and
            their knowledge/skills in coding. Interacting with others would
            vastly improve my understanding of coding, enhance any vocabulary
            gaps I may have and strengthen my listening and teaching skills
            alike.

                This is the project that changed the way i code and took it to
                another level.
              </p>
              <p>
                Designo is a 7 page website with css replication on different
                pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Designo has helped me see projects in components, rather than
                separate sections that needs to be coded individually

              <h2>Memory game (WIP)</h2>

              <p>
                The toughest part of the project was creating a function that
                would shuffle an array without repeating or losing an entry.
              </p>
              <p>
                this was the first time that I have realised how important it is
                to push my code to GitHub and use subbranches before merging to
                master

              <p>
                used Replit for the first time to tackle some of the suggested
                prompts: :
              </p>
              <p>
                Functions, Number Functions, DOM, Array Methods,FlexBox, and
                Objects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going through the prompts has made my weakness with objects
                obvious. it is not as straight forward as i thought, and i need
                to go through documentations and videos to complete it.

                toDo app was the first project that I had to link my JS
                knowledge together to make it work which.
              </p>
              <p>
                As in order to make it work I had to combine the use of
                function, Arrays, Objects, and EventListener in order to
                manipulate the DOM to store some data and have it update in the

              <p>
                I made it plane and simple in order to make it easier to
                implement the code in different projects.
